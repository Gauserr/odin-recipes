        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</li>
            <li>Lightly toast the flat side of each half of the bun in the pan
                until golden brown. Remove the buns.
            </li>
            <li>With your hands, form your ground beef into a ball, and press flat 
                on two side until a 3/4" thick patty is formed.
            </li>
            <li>Season <strong>generously</strong> on both sides of the patty with salt and pepper </li>
            <li>In a pan over medium-high heat, sear your burger on one side until 
                a crisp crust forms.
            </li>
            <li>Flip burger, lay a slice of American cheese over top, and add the 
                remainder of your butter to the pan. Let this sear until it reaches 
                an internal temp of ~135 degrees Fahrenheit, using a spoon to baste 
                the butter over top of the burger continuosly. Remove burger and let 
                set at least 5 minutes.
            </li>

                with salt and pepper, and let cook until golden on all sides. Remove onions.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together your mustard, mayo, and ketchup.</li>
            <li>Assemble by lying the bottom bun face up. In order by layer, add one 
                piece of lettuce wide enough to cover the bun, top with your patty, then with
                one slice of tomato, and your onions.
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, spread a generous serving of your sauce to the top bun, and crown 
                the burger.
