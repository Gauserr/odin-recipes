        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Beef Wellington</strong> is a steak dish popularized in England. The aesthetically 
        stunning dish is comprised of a seared and dijon-mustard brushed fillet that is wrapped in
        a mushroom <em>Duxelle</em> , parma ham, a puff-pastry, and brushed with eggwash. The dish 
        jumped in popularity after being praised and perfected by infamous chef Gordon Ramsey. While this 
        recipe guides you through creating the main entree, the dish is often supplemented with mashed potatoes,
        steamed carrots, and optionally a red wine sauce.</p>
