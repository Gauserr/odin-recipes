        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Pasta</strong> is a staple of Italian cousine, and for good reason. 
        Both filling and savory, pasta finds itself easy to incorporate in a multitude
        of other dishes. Whether by itself, covered with a red sauce, mixed with shrimp,
        or topped with a fried chicken breast, it holds its own as one of the most 
        versatile foods. This recipe is a simple, yet delicious take on an alfredo-covered
        shrimp and Fettuccini pasta dish.</p>

        <h3>Incredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 box uncooked Fettuccini noodles</li>
            <li>1 8oz. jar Alredo sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>8-10 pieces frozen shrimp</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium-sized sauce pan 3/4 full of water. Set over high heat
                until boiling.
            </li>
            <li>Season the boiling water <strong>very generously.</strong></li>
            <li>Add your noodles to the boiling water, folding the noodles over 
                themselves until they are all entirely submerged under water. </li>
            <li>Let cook for ~8 minutes or until <em><strong>al dente.</strong></em>
                Strain the water from the noodels and leave in a bowl. </li>
            <li>On a lightly-sprayed skillet, cook your shrimp over medium heat on
                each side for ~1 minute. Remove and add to bowl of pasta.
            </li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, add your alfredo sauce and let simmer over low
                heat until warm. Add the sauce to the bowl of pasta and mix.
            </li>
        </ol>
